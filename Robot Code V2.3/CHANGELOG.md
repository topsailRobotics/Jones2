These are changes made on 3/14/2024 so Willem can code rest of robot and put this on github:

- P for arm set to: 1
- Shooter Intake speed now 4 for all instances
- When we run autonomous, robot code dissapears on drivers station don't know why. Try running autonomous and practice to see what I mean. Practice tries to run a full round btw if u didn't know(auto and teleop)
